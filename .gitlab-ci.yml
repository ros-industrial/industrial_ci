# The following block is needed for the shared Docker-based runner
# For local runners you might want to enable the overlay driver:

image: docker:git # docker and git clients

# The docker runner does not expose /tmp to the docker-in-docker service
# This config ensures that the temp folder is located inside the project directory (e.g. for prerelease tests or SSH agent forwarding)
variables:
  TMPDIR: "${CI_PROJECT_DIR}.tmp" #

# enable docker-in-docker
