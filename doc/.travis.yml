# The legacy branch contains a deprecated version of industrial_ci, kept for compatibility with legacy/EOL CI setups only.
# Active development (new features, support for new ROS distros, etc.) is targeted at the master branch: https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci/tree/master
# The current set of features will be maintained as long as it is possible and reasonable.
# Please consider migrating to the new version: https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci/blob/master/doc/migration_guide.md
