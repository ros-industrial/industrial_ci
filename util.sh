# * wraps the section that is started by travis_time_start function.
# * resets signal handler for ERR to the bash default one, when `exit_code` is any error code that exits the shell. This allows subsequent signal handlers for ERR if any to be unaffected by any handlers defined beforehand.
# * exits the process if non -1 value is passed to `exit_code`.
